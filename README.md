## Quotes
- *"Friends don’t spy; true friendship is about privacy, too."* - Stephen King
- *"Ultimately, saying that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say. Or that you don't care about freedom of the press because you don't like to read. Or that you don't care about freedom of religion because you don't believe in God. Or that you don't care about the freedom to peacably assemble because you're a lazy, antisocial agoraphobe."* - Edward Snowden
- *"Security and Privacy is a part of us, it's not negotiable, it's not essential, it's a core."* - NCryptsion
- *"If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy."* - Phil Zimmermann
- *"Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data."* - Shoshana Zuboff
- *"We are all being constantly surveilled, and in this situation, the real question is not ‘What is privacy?’ but rather, ‘How are you being controlled?"* - Douglas Rushkoff
